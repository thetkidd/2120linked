# Linked List (CPSC 2120)
This is an example of a linked listed coded in C++. The list itself is written in List.h and Node.h, while main.cpp is used to run test cases (inserting and removing items in various ways, searching for items, etc.) when compiled.

# Compilation Instructions
In the terminal of your choice, compile the 3 files (List.h, Node.h, and main.cpp), then run the a.out file. However, the compiled file is already provided for ease of access.
